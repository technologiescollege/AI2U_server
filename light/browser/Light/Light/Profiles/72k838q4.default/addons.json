Now you can go one step further and also make it feel awesome to use!","fullDescription":"IMPORTANT: The add-on will not receive any more updates and will stop working by next November with Firefox 57! Click here for more info.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContact Info: For reporting problems and bugs, or if you have comments or suggestions, please either send me an email (quicksaver@gmail.com) or go to https://github.com/Quicksaver/The-Fox--Only-Better/issues and create an issue, this is so I have a way to communicate with you if I need to.\n\nAustralis was the code name of the current Firefox theme, which first appeared in Firefox 29. It was an almost complete overhaul not only of the general look of the main browser window, but also of the underlying customization system. This add-on aims to fully and seamlessly integrate with Australis, while at same time provide a different, and hopefully better, feel when using the browser.\n\nSlim Chrome: Compress the top toolbars, including the location bar, into a tiny bar at the top of the browser, to save screen space and display web content to the maximum!\n\n- To access the toolbars, just move your mouse to the top of the window, or hit F6 to focus the location bar, and they will roll out in front of you.\n\n- The navigation bar can optionally be set so that it won't hide with the other toolbars. In this case, it will remain at the top of the browser like before, and only other toolbars, such as the Bookmarks Toolbar, will be hidden.\n\n- A mini bar, containing the current location, will appear when you change webpages, or when you are typing passwords, so that you are always sure of where you are.\n-- This mini bar can optionally appear when the cursor is on any other type of input field.\n\n- In addition to its corresponding option in the add-on's preferences dialog, Slim Chrome can be enabled or disabled through the toolbars context menu, and through a customizable keyboard shortcut, which by default is F9.\n\n- There are many appearance choices available (see screenshot), and also many different animation options. Try them all and choose the combination that best suits your taste!\n\nSky Lights give you readily accessible information about the current website without having to constantly show the toolbars, as a form of visual aid neatly packed into a small area at the top of the browser.\n\nIncluded Sky Lights:\n\n- Site Identity\n-- Clicking the light will open the same informative popup that usually opens when you click the identity box in the location bar.\n-- In case firefox blocked any content from loading for your safety, you can unblock it via clicking the light as well, just as you would by clicking the shield icon in the location bar.\n-- Important: the location bar, with the currently visited URL and the identity box next to it, provides crucial security information, to let you know that you are always where you should be and that it is safe to be there. Therefore, the add-on will not allow you to disable both the Site Identity light and the mini bar when changing locations, otherwise you won't have access to this information if the toolbars are hidden. Likewise, neither feature is needed when the navigation bar isn't included in the hidden toolbars, so they won't be enabled at all in that case.\n\n- Bookmark Page\n-- An equivalent to the Star icon of the Bookmarks button; indicates whether the current page is already bookmarked.\n-- Clicking the light will bookmark the current page, or open the Edit This Bookmark panel if the page is already bookmarked.\n\n- It is possible for other add-ons to add their own Sky Light, if they wish to fully integrate with Slim Chrome via this system. Please visit the following page for more information and, to add-on developers, for easy to follow instructions on how to do this: https://github.com/Quicksaver/The-Fox--Only-Better/issues/52.\n\nEnhance your Awesome Bar: the location bar is affectionately referred to as Awesome Bar by the good folks at Mozilla that develop it, for doing so much more than just taking you to a web address. Type in any words and it searches your recent history, your bookmarks, other open tabs, searches the web using your favorite search engine and can even show you suggestions to search for.\nNow you can truly bring out the best of it. Use it and abuse it!\n- Select which types and limit or increase how many suggestions to show you as you type in the location bar.\n- Right-click any suggestion to immediately paste its value into the location bar, so that you can quickly copy it or use it with another search engine.\n- Place your search engines in the location bar's panel, and click any of them to immediately open the search results for what you typed.\n- You can right-click a search engine, or use Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down on your keyboard (Command+Up and Command+Down on Mac), to define another search engine to be used by default until you select another one.\n- Take full advantage of these suggestions by customizing them to your taste, from several different styles and color themes based on frog's AwesomeBar Popup userstyle and my own personal tweaks.\n\nAdaptable Search Bar - keeps your Search Bar synchronized with your web searches, it will always reflect the term used when browsing any results page from a search engine.\n- Optionally show the search bar only when on a results page and when it's not empty, giving it a more informative role. If you try to type in it, it will take you to the location bar so you can search from there instead.\n- In the future there will be some sort of ability to add your own custom rules for other search pages. For now, if you'd like to see any other search engine work with this feature, just let me know.\n- Currently supported search pages: Google, Yahoo, Bing, Amazon, DuckDuckGo, eBay, MercadoLibre, Twitter, Wikipedia, Facebook, IMDb, YouTube, Baidu.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/140/140326.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"514","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/140/140326.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"147","caption":"The top toolbars are compressed into a tiny bar, they will appear when you move the mouse to the top of the window."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134246.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"165","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134246.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"47","caption":"The mini location notifier will always be visible when entering passwords."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134248.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"410","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134248.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"117","caption":"Themes (Personas) are fully supported"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/140/140328.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"493","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/140/140328.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"141","caption":"The available Slim Chrome styles (from top to bottom): Australis, Spacious, Compact and Full width."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/143/143652.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"628","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/143/143652.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"180","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Sky Lights give you information about the current webpage when you need it, without the need to open the toolbars themselves."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/143/143654.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"468","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/143/143654.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"134","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Sky Lights give you information about the current webpage when you need it, without the need to open the toolbars themselves."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/171/171024.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"279","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/171/171024.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"80","caption":"It is very easy to use the location bar with your favorite search engines.

If you want to add this one, you need to remove it from Bookmarks Toolbar via \"View -> Toolbars -> Customize\". Then go to Personal Menu Options, add an available item called \"Toolbar Box\", finally you may see the \"Bookmarks Toolbar Items\" in the available item list.\n\n*** Hint about Adding Toolbar Items ***\nIn \"Edit Menus\" panel, the available toolbar items depend on \"View → Toolbars → Customize...\" panel. For example, if \"New Tab\" button is available in Customize Toolbar panel, it will be available in \"Edit Menus\" also. It means you may only add the toolbar items that do not exist in any toolbar.\n\n*** Hiding the title text of Bookmark Items and History Items ***\nThe new available items -- Bookmark Items and History Items display with a title text named \"Bookmarks\" and \"History\". You may hide the titles with userChrome.css if you don't like it:\n\n    /*hide the title of bookmark items*/\n    #cm-bookmarks-box > :first-child,\n    #cm-bookmarks-box > menuseparator {\n    display: none;\n    }\n\n    /*hide the title of history items*/\n    #cm-history-box > :first-child,\n    #cm-history-box > menuseparator {\n    display: none;\n    }\n\n\n*** Add more columns in Firefox Menu with Personal Menu 5.0 ***\n!! THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTION IS FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY !!\nSince the following steps are related to modifying JavaScript code. You should only continue if you are sure of what you are doing.\n\n    Install userChrome.js and restart Firefox.\n    Open the file \"userChrome.js\" in your profile, and paste the following code in to the file:\n\n        if (location == \"chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\") {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n        // this is the only setting you can edit\n        // each line equals to one column, wrapped with \"\" (double quotation marks)\n        // and split with , (comma)\n        var newLists = [\n        // DO NOT CHANGE THE LINES ABOVE\n        \"\",\n        \"\"\n        // DO NOT CHANGE THE LINES BELLOW\n        ];\n\n        var appmenu = document.getElementById(\"appmenu-popup\");\n        for(var i in newLists) {\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2] = appmenu.firstChild.appendChild(document.createElement(\"vbox\"));\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2].id = \"appmenu\" + (parseInt(i)+3) + \"ryPane\";\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2].cm_list = newLists[i].split(\",\");\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2].cm_topMenu = appmenu;\n        }\n        }, 10);\n        }\n\n    Open \"Personal Menu Options\".\n    Design your new column in the primary-pane in \"Edit Menu\" panel.\n    (Information: Firefox menu is divided in two columns: the left one primary-pane and the right one secondary-pane.)\n    Save the setting.\n    Go to about:config, copy the value of \"compact.menu.primaryList\" and SET IT TO EMPTY.\n    (Find \"compact.menu.secondaryList\" if you design the new column in secondary-pane.)\n    Open userChrome.js, paste the value into newLists. For example, if the value is aaa,bbb,ccc, the part of code in userChrome.js will be:\n\n        var newLists = [\n        \"aaa,bbb,ccc\",\n        \"\"\n        ];\n\n    Save userChrome.js.\n\nRepeat steps 3-8 to create your new columns. For example, the newLists bellow means creating 4 new columns:\n\n    var newLists = [\n    \"aaa,bbb,ccc\",\n    \"ddd,eee,fff\",\n    \"ggg,hhh,iii\",\n    \"jjj,kkk\"\n    ];\n\nMake sure the lines are split with comma, and there is no comma at the end of the last line.\nIf you are going to use userChrome.css to embellish the new columns, you may use the id of them in the selectors: \"appmenu3ryPane\", \"appmenu4ryPane\", etc.\n\nIn case of unexpected errors,\nDO NOT REUSE THE ITEMS THAT EXIST IN OTHER COLUMNS ALREADY!\n\n*** Why do some items become grey and disabled in Help, Tools, etc? ***\nFor example, if you add both \"Tools --> Options\" and \"Tools\" in Firefox Menu, when you open Firefox Menu, you will see the \"Options\" inside \"Tools\" is disabled. It is because Personal Menu is trying to keep the view of original menu, and create a dummy at the original position of the item. You may hide those dummy with userChrome.css:\n\n    [id^=\"cmRestorePoint-\"][disabled=\"true\"] {display: none}\n\n\n*** About Editing Right-click Menu ***\nIf you want to edit your content (right-click) menu, please try Menu Editor.\nPersonal Menu WILL NOT include this feature, since they are based on two totally different ideas.\n\n*** If There Is Not Your Language in Personal Menu ***\nIf there is not your language or it is incomplete, and you would like to be the volunteer for the translation, you are welcome to be the translator of Personal Menu! You may register in BabelZilla, then go to the page of Personal Menu, choose your language in \"Register me as translator for:\" at the bottom, and press \"Let's go\" to start your translation.\n\n\n*** Questions and Suggestions ***\nIf you have any suggestion, you are welcome to post them in \"What do you think?\" below.\nPlease notice that I can read Chinese and English only.\nSince I won't be notified when there is new review, I can't promise to reply you immediately.\nYou are welcome to discuss those problems or bugs with me by E-mail: mercichao AT gmail DOT com,

Pressing Ctrl+F11 per default hides everything, except browsing area and tabs. You can however configure it so some elements stay visible, ie the location bar. You can also set it up to hide tabs and maximize window, making it an \"Almost Fullscreen mode.\" This is perfect if you a browsing with a small screen, because the build-in Full Screen is usally too radical for browsing purposes. With this add-on, you can customize a less radical mode.\n\nTips:\n- You don't need the location-bar, because pressing ctrl+L shows a dialog, when location bar is not visible. I however prefer to keep the bar, because it allows you to see the url of the site you are on.\n- You don't need the menu bar, because hitting the \"Alt\" key opens it. I prefer disabling it\n- You don't need the status bar, but I prefer keeping it, so I can see progress when a page loads\n- You don't need the browsing buttons (back, home, etc), because there are keyboard shortcuts for all these. Its a real bonus to get rid of these, because it makes the navigation bar smaller. This plugin (currently) only allows disabling of complete bars, and not individual elements on the bars, so you need to remove the buttons in the normal mode (using firefox build-in feature)\n\nPS:\nI need to update the screenshot - there are more options available now, than the screenshot indicates\n\nFuture plans:\n- Optionally make statusbar visibility depend on status: Hidden when status is \"Done,\" visible otherwise (I have already implemented this feature as a seperate add-on: Shy Statusbar - with that add-on, the statusbar is always shy, with this addon, the statusbar will only be shy when in minimode)\n- Optionally hide elements within searchbars (Browsing buttons, search engines etc)\n- For each element, provide three options: \"hide\", \"show\" and \"don't change\"\n- Optionally set up several modes (with their own keyboard shortcuts)","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/44/44667.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"335","height":"347","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/44/44667.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"144","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Setting up which stuff you that should be hidden when entering into minimode"}],"homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minimode/?src=api","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minimode/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":4,"reviewCount":22,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minimode/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":13647,"weeklyDownloads":25,"dailyUsers":315,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/108568/minimode-1.4-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":10588,"updateDate":1296490029000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"autohidetabbar@tiptt.blogspot.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/59/59267-32.png?modified=1359195720","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/59/59267-64.png?modified=1359195720"},"type":"extension","name":"Autohide Tabbar","version":"2.8.1-signed.1-signed","creator":{"name":"Zen","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/39475zen4933217/?src=api"},"description":"This extension auto-hides the tab bar.","fullDescription":"This extension auto-hides the tab bar.
